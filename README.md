# Hyperapp-Tailwind-Parcel

## A Stack for ðŸš€ front-end design/developpement in 2019.

I want to build an app with good ux/performance and have fun while doing it:

- [x] Quick protoyping possible as well as complex production apps
- [x] Design, build and iterate straight in the browser
- [x] 0 configuration but powerful developpement tools (babel, postcss, tailwind, jsx, etc...)
- [x] Stay close to vanilla ES6
- [x] Light, fast & powerful
- [x] [SRR](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp#hydration) should be easy

## Example  
Check [Rocket Emoji](https://github.com/gary149/rocket-emoji) for a working example.

- [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) - Minimal (1kb), Functional + Stateless components
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) - Not a UI kit but a utility-first CSS framework
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) (Bundler) - Fast, 0 config
- [Purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss) - Remove unused css classes
- [JSX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx) - Write HTML tags inside javascript
