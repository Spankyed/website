    "text": `<div><p>I went to McDonalds this evening. They forgot to give me the fries that they charged me for. I didn't realize until I got home of course. I was dissapointed because I had been friendly with the lady who handed me my food, going as far as to ask her what time she got off that evening.</p><p>About 12 hours earlier, I was at the same McDonalds for a late night-early morning meal. I saw that they had sausage &amp; egg mcmuffins for half-price from 5am - 10am. When I went to order it, I was informed over the intercom that the offer didnt start for another 12 minutes. This information was provided courtesy of the same lady who would hand me a fry-less bag later that evening. With some quick maths I calculated how much money I would make in 15 mins at my job. I concluded that, relative to my hourly wage, it wouldnt be worth my time to wait the 12 minutes. I pay the full price of 3.89 and go about my morning/night.</p><p>24 hours later, 12 hours after I was handed the bag without fries, I was very hungry again. Being too early in the morning to confront a McDonalds employee about my fry situation the previous day, I decide to go to taco bell. Fortuanetly, taco bell closed 2 hours prior to my arrival. So the only other option in this percuilar situation, was to head to the McDonalds at which I was cheated out of a medium fry and denied a cheap sausage &amp; egg mcmuffin. </p><p>I make it to the drive thru menu, and proceed with my order. A quarter pounder, mchicken and a mango smoothie. It was not my normal 5am meal, i felt like improvising a little. I neglected to mention to the employee over the intercom the free medium fry that i expected to be included in my order, until I got to the window. I felt it was better to inform an employee of my sitatuion face to face rather then over an intercom. </p><p>Before I continue with the story, I just wanna mention briefly what the subject of this blog entry is: </p><blockquote><p>Never be so sure of what you want that you arent willing to take something better.</p></blockquote><p>See, I expected that whatever I ordered would include a medium fry- free of charge. I would explain my situation at the window and negotiate compesation for my losses. If they refused I would refuse to pay for the rest of my order, and threaten to take my business to another McDonalds, which conveniently happened to be just as far from my house as the current one. </p><p>Before I could proceed with this plan however, I had to go by the bank and withdraw 20 bucks. They were only accepting cash at this time. After this minor hiccup I proceeded with the plan to secure the free medium fry. I placed my order and drove up to the window; no one was there to take my payment. This wasnt a serious issue, I just needed to wait for an employee to come take my money. A thought came to my mind... what if I pretend I don't have cash, only my credit card. They would of course be annoyed, because they explicitly told me they were only taking cash and a small confrontation would likely insue. But thats it right? I would promptly tell them Im joking, then request they give me a free fry and hand them the cash for the meal. </p><blockquote><p><em>Employee</em>:  "Hery darling, quarter pounder, mchicken and a mango smoothie- $8.89".<br><em>Me</em>:  "Alright", attempts to hand employee credit card.<br><em>Employee</em>:  "Cash only"<br><em>Me</em>:  "wah?"<br><em>Employee</em>:  "I said cash only 10 times at the window.."<br><em>Me</em>:  "Oh, I didnt kno what you were saying"</p></blockquote><p>Employee: lets out big sigh, murmurs something to coworker, closes window and walks away.</p><p>At this point I know Im in for a treat. Whatever happens next is gotta be better then a medium fry. First assumption: Im getting a free meal. And sure enough that is what ocurred. </p><p>So why am I telling you this story? Well, I figured it be more interesting then writing about VDOMs. Im tryna fillup this blog with some content cause it looks wierd otherwise. And being a tech guy, my first inclination is to write about something tech related. Its what all the other cool kids are doing. So I considered writing about Virtual DOMs. I then got hungry and headed to McDonalds for my free medium fry.</p><p>Before I continue with the rest of this blog post, checkout <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Yang's</a> presidential campaign. He's like the Bernie Sanders 2.0. And he wants to give everyone 1000 bucks a month.</p><p>Anyways in recent news, I matched with the lady from McDonalds on a dating app. Perhaps one of these days Ill take her out to taco bell. She works like 12 hours a day though, which is retarded. </p><p>But you know whats not retarded? $1000 bucks a month, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz3L79mBKD0&amp;t=82s" target="_blank">Andrew Yang</a>. Really you should check em out. Hes a tech entreprenuer so hes pro-automation. Hopefully he can expedite the automation of fast food workers. No human no problem right? Shouldnt be to hard to engineer an automated solution to fast food. Theres not much special about it, its fairly straight forward. And Im confident a machine wouldnt have forgotten to give me my medium fries. They would have however, still denied the deal with the sausage &amp; egg mcmufin 12 minutes before 5. And a computer wouldnt of been subject to give me a whole meal for the free (shoutout to that lady for looking out). </p><p>Also, while your at it, checkout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb5ivvcTvRQ&amp;t=1915s" target="_blank">The Venus Project</a>. I stole the picture for this post from one of their videos so only fair I plug them somewhere in this. And if after exploring The Venus Project you still got some indeterminism left in you, listen to a talk or two by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLeQBHlWmfE" target="_blank">Jiddu Krishnamurti</a>.</p><p>Btw if you do begin to endorse Yang's platform of 1000 a month for every american, your gonna have to deal with a common objection that goes like this: giving everyone 1k a month will disensentivice work and everyone will be lazy. The objector will posit that instead you should jusr work hard, play by the rules, and you’ll go as far as your talents will take you. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRolGQ3QJPE" target="_blank">[insert link to rebuttal here]</a> </p><p> I could've summarized the link above, and perhaps related the last few paragraphs to the subject of this blog entry better, but I cant be bothered. In honesty it would be more boring than writing about VDOMs.</p><p>Stop wage slavery, vote for Andrew Yang.  </p><p>Alright I'm out peace. </p></div>`,
