    "description": "Web App to translate YouTube closed captions",
    "text": `<p>I wanted to learn a new language to show off on my resume and to the ladies. So I decided to build this app. The goal was to be able to listen to a YouTube video in English and see the captions in a different language.</p><p>First I needed to get the captions for a YouTube video. I googled it, and found that you can get the caption for a video by using a special YouTube URL that looks like this.</p><blockquote>  <p>http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/[VIDEOID]/captiondata/[CAPTION TRACKID]</p></blockquote><p>So all I really needed to do was translate these captions. For this I did some research into Google's translate service. After creating a service account, I devised a plan to communicate with the Google’s API. I wanted to do the least work possible. In order to use the service I had to send the API endpoint a key along with my translation request. And I couldn't put the key on the client/webpage of course, because then anyone who visits the site will have the key to my Google translate service account. </p><p>So I needed to put the key to use the service on a server. Then the webpage could make requests to that server. Things were coming along. I designed and wired up a user interface to fetch the YouTube closed captions, then that webpage could send those captions to my server, which would then get sent to Google translate, then back to my server, then to the webpage. And vioala.</p><p>One problem. I couldn't request the YouTube captions from my webpage. Something something, cross-site scripting, something something, CORS. In other words, the browser wasn’t cool with my webpage accessing captions from Youtube’s servers, because YouTube hadn't said it was ok.</p><p>Luckily I had a server already setup for the purpose of hiding my Google key and getting the translations. And since servers do not conform to CORS policies, I could just use it as a reverse proxy to request the captions for my webpage. Then send em off to google for translations.</p><p>I like to think the rest was history. However, I had a number of problems still to encounter. I decided to host the webpage on GitHub pages. And because my app is a “single-page-application”, GitHub didn't know how to handle the routing for my application. </p><p>In theory, the routing is simple, the user goes from the main page to a page with a video and translated captions. However the page with the video and translated text isn’t actually a different page. It’s just the same page being rerendered through some fancy sleight of hand. For that reason GitHub doesn’t know what to do when the URL changes. GitHubs like oh shit the user just requested some URL, lets tell the webserver to fetch that new page, but oh wait, there’s no page matching that URL. </p><p>Instead of making a request to the webserver, I need the page to do nothing. So I used a hack where you can have a 404 (resource not found) page, that GitHub redirects to when it can’t find the pages. And that 404 page redirects to the main page after storing the URL with the video ID in session memory. The problem then becomes making use of the session memory, because if I naively set the page location GitHub will trigger a page request, and then I’m in a circle jerk. I learned you can push state to the location history, which won’t trigger this loop. Then hope and pray my single-page-application understands the location history changes and acts accordingly.</p><p>Of course my application didn’t understand shit. So instead I just turned the 404 page into a second copy of the application to handle routing to the captions page. This has been the only thing that has worked so far. I could've made it so that the app doesn’t use the current URL to retrieve captions and translations. But that’s no fun and is not how the cool kids are doing shit. Plus, it means the user has to go through the application UI every time they want to get a video with translated captions, instead of just copy and pasting a URL they may have previously visited.</p><p>Eventually I showed this project off to one of my coworkers. To my delight, he informed me that YouTube already translates captions into any language for you, you just have to click captions settings, then auto translate and boom. </p><p>So ya, thanks Phil. Also the app is currently broken, which you probably realized. I'll fix it at some point.</p>`,

    "text": `<p>Writing these entries is starting to feel like a full on chore. And like any chore, lets just get straight into it.</p><p>Today I met with the CEO of <a href="https://www.bundleiq.com/">BundleIQ</a>. <span id="text_1081770435135" class="highlight">If you know me, you know this is definitely my feng shui</span>. Most of the people I associate with are bosses in their domains. As a matter of fact, yesterday I was speaking with the CEO of <a href="https://bocacode.com/">Boca Code</a>. And I've had a few other meetings this week with people of importance. </p><p>We are going  to comeback to my meeting with Nick, the CEO of BundleIQ. First, let me take this opportunity to direct any employers to my newly refined <a href="#" onclick="window.open('https://spankyed.github.io/Angel_Resume.pdf', '_-blank', 'fullscreen=yes'); return false;">resume</a>, a la <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a>. The other day I had asked my friend Todd, the CEO of Boca Code, to shit on my resume. He did. And today I learned that <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a> makes resumes for you. </p><p>It was kinda crazy actually, here I am closing out my browser tabs and in the very last tab pops up a very well done resume for myself. At first I thought I was looking at something Todd had sent me. But upon further examination, I realized it was an "Indeed" webpage delivering me this present. The best part is that it was practically a mirror image of the examples Todd had showed me the day before. Except it was mine. <span id="text_1071500758571" class="highlight">I'm going to send him this copy now and see what he thinks</span>. </p><p>Alright, lets start chopping at the topic of this entry. I met Nick in a slack group. I'd been advised by Todd and others to check out some slack channels for job postings. Todd showed me how to use the search bar in slack to look for posts with keywords like cofounder. While searching one of the channels, I found a post made by Nick who was looking for a technical cofounder. I sent him a message and thus began our conversation.  </p><p>Pause right here. Ight so check it. Cause I know what alot of you <span id="text_293445732369" class="highlight">so called myselfers</span> out there are thinking after reading those last few sentences … </p><p><span id="text_271896358205" class="highlight">"Were'nt you just a web designer like 4 blog entries ago. Now you're shooting your shot as a technical cofounder?"</span></p><p>First off, <span id="text_985895145102" class="highlight">it was 5 entries ago</span>, and second of all, I don't appreciate the way yal are coming at me. Knowing my struggle, and the work I put in, yal want to come at me sideways like that. Ima remember that shit.</p><p>Look bro, all I can say is <span id="text_165662393160" class="highlight">I get shit done</span>. Been doing this since I was a jit. I was 11 sitting at my computer writing down <span id="text_1519863590231" class="highlight">Java code on a piece of paper</span>. That same year I setup my laptop as a game server. Picture a short, curly haired, black kid back in 2007 downloading no-ip so he could forward traffic to a slow ass computer so 3 people could login into his RSPS. <span id="text_508530884715" class="highlight">By 13 I was making fire ass business graphics to sell my gaming services on Zybes</span>. At 14, while yal was worried about <span id="text_1210293116337" class="highlight">sneaking out to go smoke your reefer</span> and fornicate with the opposite sex, I was worried about sneaking under my bed to check my laptop and make sure the bots I'd programmed were still up and running. </p><p>Clearly I'm just built differently. Cut from a more illustrious cloth. <span id="text_1310005886132" class="highlight">I am the traveler</span>.</p><p>Nah but in all serious, I'm just shooting my shot. Miss 100% of ones you don't take am I right. And ya know, I've always been the sink or swim kinda guy. When I can, I push through. In retrospect, I don't know of any job I've taken up where I met all the requirements beforehand. <span id="text_1281730851274" class="highlight">Hell, in a way, the requirements were met just by me showing up</span>.</p><p>What do I mean? For Instance, if someone wanted to get into skateboarding right, the first step would be showing up to the skatepark with a board ready to skate. In other words, showing up is half the battle. The rest of the battle is becoming one with the task at hand, and believing you can achieve. Plus time, effort, natural talent, whatever whatever.</p><p>How hard could it be? Nick sent over a review of the tech stack and I pretty much checked off most of the stuff as being things I'm already familiar with or could easily learn about. There was a few big words in there like Kubernetes and PBKDF2 encryption, but we not finna let that get to us. I look words like that in the eye and say, fuck out of here.</p><p>Lets be honest though. I have 3 fears in life. And big words like kubernetes, <span id="text_553239756604" class="highlight">determinism</span>, and <span id="text_1419021458522" class="highlight">commitment</span> are all of them. So ya, Ima keep yal posted on the situation. </p><p>In other business related news, a researcher named Marc messaged me a few weeks ago looking to start a Nutritions Company. Work on this is planned to begin in about a week. Marc is a Scientist at <a href="https://www.uni-marburg.de/en">Philipps University of Marburg</a> in Germany. German graduates go to him for help with their masters thesis. He has some good ideas. He wants to look at the body as a blackbox with inputs and outputs. Control the input and you can control the output. </p><p>For a little check on the weather, it is currently raining. Which sucks cause I kinda wanted to go skate. My friend Caleb hit me up this morning to go out to Miami and skate Lot 11. I was just like bro I live wellington now, thats a bop and a half. Its all cool though, cause I had plans to finish writing this blog entry anyways. Which if you cant tell is wrapping up. Still tryna figure out how Ima do that. Think Ima just leave yal with some shit like this..</p><p><span id="text_1108273516151" class="highlight">No matter what, keep your head up. Even in the darkest moments you can find a reason to smile.</span> </p>`,

    "text": `<div><p>I went to McDonalds this evening. They forgot to give me the fries that they charged me for. I didn't realize until I got home of course. I was dissapointed because I had been friendly with the lady who handed me my food, going as far as to ask her what time she got off that evening.</p><p>About 12 hours earlier, I was at the same McDonalds for a late night-early morning meal. I saw that they had sausage &amp; egg mcmuffins for half-price from 5am - 10am. When I went to order it, I was informed over the intercom that the offer didnt start for another 12 minutes. This information was provided courtesy of the same lady who would hand me a fry-less bag later that evening. With some quick maths I calculated how much money I would make in 15 mins at my job. I concluded that, relative to my hourly wage, it wouldnt be worth my time to wait the 12 minutes. I pay the full price of 3.89 and go about my morning/night.</p><p>24 hours later, 12 hours after I was handed the bag without fries, I was very hungry again. Being too early in the morning to confront a McDonalds employee about my fry situation the previous day, I decide to go to taco bell. Fortuanetly, taco bell closed 2 hours prior to my arrival. So the only other option in this percuilar situation, was to head to the McDonalds at which I was cheated out of a medium fry and denied a cheap sausage &amp; egg mcmuffin. </p><p>I make it to the drive thru menu, and proceed with my order. A quarter pounder, mchicken and a mango smoothie. It was not my normal 5am meal, i felt like improvising a little. I neglected to mention to the employee over the intercom the free medium fry that i expected to be included in my order, until I got to the window. I felt it was better to inform an employee of my sitatuion face to face rather then over an intercom. </p><p>Before I continue with the story, I just wanna mention briefly what the subject of this blog entry is: </p><blockquote><p>Never be so sure of what you want that you arent willing to take something better.</p></blockquote><p>See, I expected that whatever I ordered would include a medium fry- free of charge. I would explain my situation at the window and negotiate compesation for my losses. If they refused I would refuse to pay for the rest of my order, and threaten to take my business to another McDonalds, which conveniently happened to be just as far from my house as the current one. </p><p>Before I could proceed with this plan however, I had to go by the bank and withdraw 20 bucks. They were only accepting cash at this time. After this minor hiccup I proceeded with the plan to secure the free medium fry. I placed my order and drove up to the window; no one was there to take my payment. This wasnt a serious issue, I just needed to wait for an employee to come take my money. A thought came to my mind... what if I pretend I don't have cash, only my credit card. They would of course be annoyed, because they explicitly told me they were only taking cash and a small confrontation would likely insue. But thats it right? I would promptly tell them Im joking, then request they give me a free fry and hand them the cash for the meal. </p><blockquote><p><em>Employee</em>:  "Hery darling, quarter pounder, mchicken and a mango smoothie- $8.89".<br><em>Me</em>:  "Alright", attempts to hand employee credit card.<br><em>Employee</em>:  "Cash only"<br><em>Me</em>:  "wah?"<br><em>Employee</em>:  "I said cash only 10 times at the window.."<br><em>Me</em>:  "Oh, I didnt kno what you were saying"</p></blockquote><p>Employee: lets out big sigh, murmurs something to coworker, closes window and walks away.</p><p>At this point I know Im in for a treat. Whatever happens next is gotta be better then a medium fry. First assumption: Im getting a free meal. And sure enough that is what ocurred. </p><p>So why am I telling you this story? Well, I figured it be more interesting then writing about VDOMs. Im tryna fillup this blog with some content cause it looks wierd otherwise. And being a tech guy, my first inclination is to write about something tech related. Its what all the other cool kids are doing. So I considered writing about Virtual DOMs. I then got hungry and headed to McDonalds for my free medium fry.</p><p>Before I continue with the rest of this blog post, checkout <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Yang's</a> presidential campaign. He's like the Bernie Sanders 2.0. And he wants to give everyone 1000 bucks a month.</p><p>Anyways in recent news, I matched with the lady from McDonalds on a dating app. Perhaps one of these days Ill take her out to taco bell. She works like 12 hours a day though, which is retarded. </p><p>But you know whats not retarded? $1000 bucks a month, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz3L79mBKD0&amp;t=82s" target="_blank">Andrew Yang</a>. Really you should check em out. Hes a tech entreprenuer so hes pro-automation. Hopefully he can expedite the automation of fast food workers. No human no problem right? Shouldnt be to hard to engineer an automated solution to fast food. Theres not much special about it, its fairly straight forward. And Im confident a machine wouldnt have forgotten to give me my medium fries. They would have however, still denied the deal with the sausage &amp; egg mcmufin 12 minutes before 5. And a computer wouldnt of been subject to give me a whole meal for the free (shoutout to that lady for looking out). </p><p>Also, while your at it, checkout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb5ivvcTvRQ&amp;t=1915s" target="_blank">The Venus Project</a>. I stole the picture for this post from one of their videos so only fair I plug them somewhere in this. And if after exploring The Venus Project you still got some indeterminism left in you, listen to a talk or two by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLeQBHlWmfE" target="_blank">Jiddu Krishnamurti</a>.</p><p>Btw if you do begin to endorse Yang's platform of 1000 a month for every american, your gonna have to deal with a common objection that goes like this: giving everyone 1k a month will disensentivice work and everyone will be lazy. The objector will posit that instead you should jusr work hard, play by the rules, and you’ll go as far as your talents will take you. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRolGQ3QJPE" target="_blank">[insert link to rebuttal here]</a> </p><p> I could've summarized the link above, and perhaps related the last few paragraphs to the subject of this blog entry better, but I cant be bothered. In honesty it would be more boring than writing about VDOMs.</p><p>Stop wage slavery, vote for Andrew Yang.  </p><p>Alright I'm out peace. </p></div>`,

    "text": `<div><p>Alright so Im not a crappy person. Sometimes I just think like one. </p><p>Like this afternoon when I got a message from someone "looking for help with web design". It was obvious the guy had messaged the wrong person. Im a web developer (aka software developer/engineer). Not a web designer. But hold on, </p><blockquote><p>after reading your Simbi page, I wonder if you might also be able to help me with another goal of mine. </p></blockquote><p>Hopefully something developer oriented, am I right?</p><blockquote><p>Do you see this set-up here: <a href="http://www.dungeonsanddevelopers.com" target="_blank">www.dungeonsanddevelopers.com</a>? Id really love to find a way to copy it (or make my own), where I can make my own talent tree, add my own images and text</p></blockquote><p>Heres a list of things Id really love... </p><p>Id really love a puppy. Id really love a decent haircut. Id really love to see a few people attempt to drop in at my local skatepark. Id really love for there to be more 3D character artists/animators on the internet willing to work for free. Id really love it if Rune Skovbo could help Mackey calculate 2D blend trees in javascript so I can steal his animation code. Id really love it if the bank would stop forclosing on my home. Id really love to write a good blog entry.</p><p>I probably wouldnt mind making a skill/talent tree for the guy messaging me either. I mean I have to do something similar to interface with the dialog tree from Watson Assistant for one of my project anyways. Plus if I decide not to help him, he might try to say I stole his idea and used it in one of my projects.</p><p> If you havent visited the <a href="http://www.dungeonsanddevelopers.com/" target="_blank">Dungeon And Developers</a> website yet, dont worry, I already did it for you. Its basically a quiz to test how talented you are in web development. Im a lvl 24 web developer. </p><p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SYvFkRA.png" alt="level-24-developer"><br>Who am I fooling Im no lvl 24 web developer. Im a web designer at best. I should be honored that someone even messaged me for my help. Fuck my career aspirations, right? I am curently reevaluating why I signed up on that sYmBiOtiC site in the first place. My house is getting forclosed, I need to be looking for a way to pay this mortgage, not designing someones skill tree for the free. </p><p>If your still reading this, let me take this opportunity to share with you my <a href="#" onclick="window.open('https://spankyed.github.io/Angel_Resume.pdf', '_-blank', 'fullscreen=yes'); return false;">resume</a> in case your considering hiring me for a job (please help).</p><p>Idk where im going with this blog. Its my first time, go easy on me . If this blog hasnt been useful for anything, jus know... you should try and eat a mango while its still mostly green. The way I see it, most the mangos you will ever eat will probably be ripe and mostly yellow. But if your like me, and you really love mangos, try mixing it up by eating one while its still a little bitter. Its a nice way to condition yourselve for the bullsh-</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JH5R83O.jpg" alt="green-mangos"></p><p>Crap, I suck at blogging. Feel like I couldve written the whole thing backwards and it wouldve still made as much sense. I hope I get better at this. And by get better, I mean I hope it takes less time cause I got other stuff to do. Btw there may have been more to the site that I titled this entry after. I just didnt care enough to look into it.  Supposedly its an RPG?</p><p>I think the real takeaway here is this: if you wanna get someone to help you with something, make them reevaluate their identity, and provide them an opportunity to prove that they arent an imposter. And preferably get them to do so at a very challening moment in their lives.</p><p>If you dont wanna hire me you can support me on patreon. Im tryna buy a racing sim rig. I will design you a website for all donations over $50. I havent really setup the patreon yet, so just cashapp me and we will work it out.</p></div>`,
